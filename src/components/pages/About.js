      Full Stack web developer with a background in Political Science and International Studies. Recently earned a certificate in full stack development from the Coding Boot Camp at UCLA Extension; developed new skills that include: HTML, CSS,  JavaScript, BootStrap, APIâ€™s, Node, Express, MySQL, MVC Paradigm, Sequilieze, React, MongoDB, and MERN Stack. I applied HTML, CSS, handlebars.js Javascript and MySQL in a recent group project with 3 other people where we created a full stack website called Cream Finder that will help ice cream truck drivers with sharing their routes with users that enjoy ice cream. I am excited to use my newly developed skills in a fast-paced and driven team to build websites that users will enjoy.
